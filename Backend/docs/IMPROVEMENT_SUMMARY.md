# AiMusicSeparator-AI separator backend Improvement Summary

## Overview

This document provides a brief summary of the planned improvements for the AiMusicSeparator-AI separator backend project. For a full detailed list, please refer to [TODO.md](./TODO.md).

## Key Improvement Areas

### Performance & Scaling

The backend will be enhanced to better handle multiple requests and process large files more efficiently. This includes model caching to avoid reloading models (particularly Whisper and MusicGen) on each request and implementing a background task queue for long-running operations.

### Code Organization

The current `app.py` will be refactored into modular components using Flask Blueprints, with separate route files for each major functionality (audio separation, transcription, music generation). This will improve maintainability and make the codebase easier to extend.

### Security

Security improvements will include adding proper authentication (OAuth2/JWT tokens), implementing more robust validation for file uploads and user inputs, and improving CORS policy for production environments.

### Testing & Quality Assurance

Comprehensive unit tests will be added for all endpoints, along with integration tests for model processors. The project will also implement API contract tests and set up continuous integration.

### Documentation

API documentation will be expanded with Swagger/OpenAPI specifications, including usage examples for all endpoints and detailed guides for each model's processing capabilities.

## Implementation Timeline

The improvements will be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Code organization and documentation improvements
2. **Phase 2:** Performance and scaling enhancements
3. **Phase 3:** Security hardening
4. **Phase 4:** Testing and quality assurance
