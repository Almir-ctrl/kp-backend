# Session Summary â€” October 21, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on:
- Fixing frontend audio player controls
- Enabling GPU acceleration for all AI models (RTX 5070 Ti, CUDA 12.4)
- Implementing Gemma 3N audio analysis and lyrics sync (word-level timing)
- Ensuring all changes are backward compatible and do not affect other models
- Resolving Docker build issues with PyTorch nightly

---

## Chronological Summary

### 1. **Lion's Roar Studio Audio Player Fixes**
- Problem: Play/Pause button did not work due to logic in `ControlHub.tsx`.
- Solution: Added `togglePlayPause()` to `AppContext.tsx` and updated `ControlHub.tsx` to use it.
- Result: Main player controls now work as expected.

### 2. **GPU Acceleration for AI separator backend**
- Problem: RTX 5070 Ti (sm_120) not supported by stable PyTorch; required nightly build.
- Solution: Installed PyTorch Nightly 2.10.0+cu129, fixed environment variables for subprocesses, and created a `demucs_wrapper.py` to bypass torchaudio DLL issues.
- Result: All models now use GPU acceleration; backend runs in venv with correct CUDA support.

### 3. **Karaoke Lyric Splitting**
- Problem: Karaoke generation produced only 1 lyric line.
- Solution: Improved splitting logic in backend to use sentences and word chunks.
- Result: Karaoke now generates multiple lyric lines for better display.

### 4. **Gemma 3N Audio-Lyrics Sync**
- Implemented `analyze_word_timing()` in `Gemma3NProcessor` for word-level timing using librosa onset detection.
- Added `/sync-lyrics/<file_id>` endpoint to backend for real-time lyrics sync.
- Updated frontend `ControlHub.tsx` to use new endpoint and update `timedLyrics` for highlighting.
- Result: Users can now sync lyrics to audio with word-level precision and see real-time highlighting in karaoke mode.

### 5. **Dependency Upgrades**
- Upgraded `transformers` and `accelerate` for Gemma 3N compatibility.
- Confirmed this does not affect Demucs, Whisper, MusicGen, or PitchAnalysis.

### 6. **Docker Build Issue**
- Problem: PyTorch nightly dependency conflict in Docker build.
- Solution: Advised to use matching nightly versions for torch, torchvision, and torchaudio.
- Confirmed this is unrelated to transformers/accelerate upgrade.

## Key Decisions
- All new features are backward compatible and do not affect other models.
- Lyrics sync is an optional add-on; existing workflows are unchanged.
- Docker build errors are isolated to PyTorch nightly versioning, not related to other upgrades.
