## 🧪 What Needs Testing

### High Priority Tests (Must Do)
- [ ] **Test DELETE endpoint** (curl or frontend Delete button)
  - Expected: No CORS errors
  - Expected: Song removed from backend storage
  - Time: 30 seconds

- [ ] **Upload NEW song** (to use Whisper workflow)
  - Expected: AI separator backend logs show "Whisper transcription completed"
  - Expected: Karaoke generation succeeds
  - Time: 2-3 minutes

- [ ] **Verify LyricsWindow** (after new upload)
  - Expected: Shows actual song lyrics
  - Expected: NOT audio analysis text
  - Time: 1 minute

### Medium Priority Tests (Should Do)
- [ ] **External player** (with new song playing)
  - Expected: Shows synced lyrics
  - Expected: NOT "waiting for lyrics data"
  - Time: 1 minute

- [ ] **Check karaoke files** (LRC format)
  - Location: `outputs/Karaoke-pjesme/{file_id}/`
  - Expected: Contains actual lyrics
  - Expected: NOT technical analysis
  - Time: 30 seconds

### Low Priority Tests (Nice to Have)
- [ ] **AI separator backend response structure** (Console inspection)
  - Expected: `transcription` field with Whisper data
  - Expected: `audio_analysis` field with Gemma 3N data (optional)
  - Time: 1 minute

- [ ] **Old songs compatibility** (play existing song)
  - Expected: Still works (backwards compatible)
  - Note: May have wrong lyrics (Gemma 3N analysis)
  - Time: 30 seconds

## 📋 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
```powershell
# 1. Test DELETE
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/songs/test-id -v
# Look for: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * in headers

# 2. Upload song
# - Lion's Roar Studio: Go to SongEditor
# - Upload audio file
# - Enter artist/song name
# - Watch backend terminal for "Whisper transcription completed"

# 3. Check lyrics
# - Select uploaded song
# - Open LyricsWindow
# - Verify: Shows actual lyrics (not analysis)

# Done! ✅
```

### Full Test (10 minutes)
See `QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing workflow

## 🔍 Verification Points

### AI separator backend Logs Should Show:
```
Auto-transcribing {file_id} with Whisper         ← NEW
Whisper transcription completed successfully     ← NEW
Analyzing audio with Gemma 3N                    ← NEW (optional)
Gemma 3N analysis completed successfully         ← NEW (optional)
Auto-generating karaoke for {file_id}
Karaoke generation completed
```

### AI separator backend Logs Should NOT Show:
```
Auto-transcribing {file_id} with Gemma 3n       ← OLD (if seen, restart needed)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Old Songs vs New Songs
| Aspect | Old Songs (Before Fix) | New Songs (After Fix) |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Transcription** | Gemma 3N (audio analysis) | Whisper (actual lyrics) |
| **Karaoke Content** | Analysis text | Real lyrics |
| **Still Works?** | ✅ Yes (backwards compatible) | ✅ Yes (new workflow) |
| **Lyrics Correct?** | ❌ No (shows analysis) | ✅ Yes (shows lyrics) |
| **Action Needed** | Re-upload to fix | None - already correct |

### AI separator backend Restart Verification
```powershell
# Check if changes are active:
# 1. Look at terminal startup logs
# 2. Should see: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"
# 3. Try upload - logs should show "Whisper transcription"
# 4. If shows "Gemma 3n transcription" → restart needed

# Restart command:
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force
python app.py
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Problem: DELETE Still Shows CORS Error
**Solution:**
```powershell
# AI separator backend might not have restarted
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force
cd C:\Users\almir\AiMusicSeparator-AI separator backend
python app.py
```

### Problem: Lyrics Still Show Analysis Text
**Cause:** Old song (uploaded before fix)  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Delete old song (DELETE endpoint now works!)
# Re-upload song
# New upload will use Whisper
```

### Problem: AI separator backend Shows "Gemma 3n transcription"
**Cause:** Old code still running  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Force restart
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force
python app.py
# Wait for "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"
```

### Problem: Lion's Roar Studio Not Updating
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Hard refresh
# Ctrl + Shift + R in browser

# Or clear cache and restart
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "node_modules/.vite"
npm run dev
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Changed
1. **DELETE Endpoint:** Added full CRUD support for songs
2. **Transcription Engine:** Whisper (correct) replaced Gemma 3N (wrong)
3. **Architecture:** Clear separation: transcription vs analysis
4. **Response Structure:** Separate fields for different AI outputs

### Why It Matters
- **Before:** Gemma 3N returned audio analysis → karaoke had wrong content
- **After:** Whisper returns actual lyrics → karaoke has correct content
- **Impact:** LyricsWindow and external player now show real song lyrics

## 🚀 Next Session Preparation

### If Issues Found During Testing
1. Document the issue in new GitHub issue or Discord
2. Include:
   - What you tested
   - What happened vs what was expected
   - AI separator backend logs (if relevant)
   - Lion's Roar Studio console errors (if relevant)
   - File ID of test song (if relevant)

### If Everything Works
1. Mark this checklist as complete ✅
2. Consider testing with different:
   - Song genres (rap, rock, classical)
   - Audio quality (low bitrate, high bitrate)
   - Song lengths (short, long)
3. Optional: Test Gemma 3N analysis output (if interested in audio features)
