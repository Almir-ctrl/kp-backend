Session summary â€” 2025-10-21

What I changed in this session:

1) CI workflows
- Added `.github/workflows/ci-basic.yml` (baseline checks)
- Added `.github/workflows/ci-fast.yml` (matrixed, cached fast checks with mocked Playwright E2E)
- Added `.github/workflows/full-stack-e2e.yml` (manual workflow to start backend + full Playwright E2E)

2) Tests and runtime guards
- AI separator backend: `tests/test_upload_duplicate.py` (pytest verifying duplicate upload 409 behavior)
- Lion's Roar Studio: `src/__tests__/duplicateUpload.test.tsx` (Jest test that mocks 409 duplicate response)
- Lion's Roar Studio: added `test:unit` and `test:dom` npm scripts (Node vs jsdom test environments)
- Fixed import-time DOM issues by adding guards in `context/AppContext.tsx` and `components/ControlHub.tsx` to make tests importable in Node/jsdom.

3) Documentation and helper files
- Added `.github/README_CI.md` with CI run instructions.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with this session's summary.
- Created this `RECENT_SESSION_SUMMARY.md` file with detailed context and next steps.

4) Security incident and remedial steps (in-progress)
- GitHub secret scanning blocked a push because a Hugging Face token was found in `.env` and `setup_hf_token.py`.
- Backup branch created: `backup/feat/fix-appcontext-dupkeys-before-purge`.
- Sensitive files removed from index and `.gitignore` was created/updated to ignore `.env`.
- Attempted to run `git-filter-repo`; it was not available in the environment, so `git filter-branch` was used as a fallback but it requires a clean working tree.
- Stash/pop actions were interrupted; the purge is currently paused. Next steps require revoking the exposed token and then proceeding to finish history rewrite and force-push.

Next steps (actionable):
- Immediately revoke/rotate the Hugging Face token referenced in `.env` and `setup_hf_token.py`.
- Once revoked, continue the history purge and force-push the cleaned `feat/fix-appcontext-dupkeys` branch.
- Open a PR from `feat/fix-appcontext-dupkeys` with a description of the changes and CI run instructions.
- Implement the new todo items added to the project's todo list (theme picker visibility, Whisper model upgrade, rewire transcription/timestamps, and Lion's Roar orchestration) in follow-up PRs.

Notes and assumptions:
- I did not revoke or rotate any tokens (must be done by account owner).
- History rewrite will require a forced push; collaborators must rebase.
- If you prefer, we can use the BFG clean tool instead of `git filter-branch` (BFG is faster and simpler for removing large files and secrets), but it requires Java.

If you'd like me to finish the purge now I will:
- Stash remaining local changes and run the filter-branch purge again (or BFG if preferred/available).
- Force-push the cleaned branch and open the PR.

If you want to handle token rotation first, tell me when it's done and I'll finish the purge and push.
