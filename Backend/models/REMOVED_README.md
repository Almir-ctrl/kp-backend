# AI separator backend/models/ — files removed and canonical docs moved

This folder used to contain model documentation and related artifacts. Those
files have been removed from this directory and consolidated under the
canonical microservices layout at `/part of AI separator backend/<model>/`.

Why the change
- Avoid duplication and drift — the single source-of-truth for model docs is
  now in `part of AI separator backend/`.
- `AI separator backend/models/` previously contained archived copies and pointers which
  caused confusion and duplicated maintenance effort.

What happened
- Most files that used to live here were removed on 2025-10-23.
- A short mapping of common files -> new canonical locations is included
  below to help integrators and automation.

Canonical mapping (representative)

- `GEMMA3N_QUICK_START.md` -> `/part of AI separator backend/gemma3n/GEMMA_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `GEMMA3N_MIGRATION.md` -> `/part of AI separator backend/gemma3n/GEMMA_3N_MIGRATION.md`
- `GEMMA3N_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` -> `/part of AI separator backend/gemma3n/README.md`
- `KARAOKE_GUIDE.md` -> `/part of AI separator backend/whisperer/WHISPER_KARAOKE_FIX.md`
- `MODEL_SELECTION_GUIDE.md` -> `/part of AI separator backend/demucs/MULTI_MODEL_GUIDE.md`
- `MUSICGEN_FIX_SUMMARY.md` -> `/part of AI separator backend/musicgen/MUSICGEN_GUIDE.md`
- `ENHANCED_PROGRESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` -> `/part of AI separator backend/chroma/ENHANCED_CHROMA_ANALYSIS.md`
- `ALL_MODELS_DOCUMENTED.md` -> `/part of AI separator backend/README.md`

If you relied on any of the removed files in automation, CI, or scripts,
update them to reference the canonical locations above. If you need any of
the removed files restored in place for compatibility, open an issue and
include the automation/script path (or ask here and I can restore a copy).

If you need the full archived mapping removed from this directory, I can
also add `AI separator backend/models/ARCHIVED_FILES_LIST.md` back or move it to
`dev/archives/` for long-term preservation — tell me which you prefer.

-- Repository maintenance script (performed)
- Removed legacy files from `AI separator backend/models/` and consolidated docs under
  `/part of AI separator backend/` (2025-10-23).

If you want to remove the originals from `AI separator backend/models/` locally, you can
run the following PowerShell commands from the repository root (they are
non-destructive because the files already exist under
`docs/archives/Backend_models/`):

```powershell
# Move originals into the archive directory (preserves history)
Get-ChildItem -Path .\AI separator backend\models\ -Filter "*.md" -File |
  Where-Object { $_.Name -notin @('README.md','ARCHIVED_FILES_LIST.md','REMOVED_README.md') } |
  ForEach-Object { Move-Item $_.FullName -Destination .\docs\archives\Backend_models\ -Force }

# Optional: remove any empty folders under AI separator backend/models (if any remain)
Get-ChildItem -Path .\AI separator backend\models\ -Directory | Where-Object { (Get-ChildItem $_.FullName -Recurse | Measure-Object).Count -eq 0 } | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse
```

Run those only after verifying the archive copies in `docs/archives/Backend_models/`.

If you'd like, I can perform the safe-move now and re-run the link-check. Reply with "MOVE" to proceed, or "LEAVE" to keep the originals.
